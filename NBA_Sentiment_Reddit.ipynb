            "I understand the context in which you are replying but don’t understand the relevance. According to the website you linked, the lakers vs Celtics matchups ranked #23 and #37, which are not consistent with your claim that these were “probably the best games this season.” Additionally, the rankings on the website are all decided by less than 200 voters, with many of them being less than 100 voters- how is this at all representative of the millions of people who watched these games? Sure, being 23rd and 37 is better than not being on the list at all, but even if we are considering such small sample sizes to represent the entire population of viewers watching these games- how can the conclusions from that website be applied to the playoffs? If we are to go off your website, the Knicks vs Mavs is the best possible finals matchup. Does this sound true? Is there anyone in this sub who thinks a 2nd round exit and a team that intentionally tanked at the end of the season to get a higher draft spot/didn’t even make the playoffs would be the best finals matchup? But back to my original point of relevance, you are claiming that a Boston vs LA finals matchup would be better than Denver vs Miami bc they had “better regular season matchups” but, as we’ve seen w teams like LA, you can’t really extend regular season outcomes to the playoffs, especially bc u guys were a$$ for most of the season. As was Miami. U can keep blabbering about irrelevant things such as how much more entertaining you think a matchup between two teams many people are tired of seeing flop/complain all the time would be, but at the end of the day ur team is down 0-3 to a team that very much deserves to be in the finals after playing well ALL YEAR with guys they’ve developed. So to address your final few sentences: “you guys” didn’t vote for anything bc the website is too small of a sample size to draw conclusions from, no one is a liar other than the 80% of lakers fans who claimed they would easily win the finals, and both Miami and Denver deserve to be in the finals bc they rightfully are both up 3-0 over teams that aren’t playing well rn.

            "If you want to learn about how big of a sample size is large enough to get a statistically accurate prediction you can learn about that on your own. I wasn't claiming millions of viewers either, the average comment count of these game threads are less than 25,000 for even playoff games and each user comments 30-50 times throughout the game. So your math is way the fuck off but nice try. \n",
            "\n",

Whatever it is about the matchup between those two teams bring out a great viewing experience. That has nothing to do with the performance of either team throughout the rest of the season. LMAO\n",
            "\n",
            "Now to your point about teams flopping and and foul baiting. It's ironic because the Lakers / Warriors series was by far the most entertaining series so far in the playoffs. Also ironic that the Lakers have been hurt by officiating the most in the regular season this year per reddit users opinions immediately after watching the games and it's just a coincidence that they lost the Celtics game because of this. \n",

            "It seems that my comment struck a nerve , which I guess makes sense considering you continue to type long-winded responses trying to prove how two teams that are both down 0-3 would be a better finals matchup. I understand that you are likely frustrated that your team wont be in the finals this year but this conversation isn’t getting anywhere bc you are blinded by the delusion that two teams who are DOWN THREE GAMES TO 0 would be a better finals matchup than the teams that are not just beating, but destroying them. And no matter what way you twist it, you cannot rely on under 100 people to draw a conclusion about what were the best games of the season. And, as you said, teams such as the Mavs were not the same team during that point in the season as they were at the end, just the same as Miami and LA not being great for most of the season and now being in the conference finals. Which proves my reasoning for claiming that u can’t use regular season “votes on top games” to conclude that Boston-LA is a better matchup. Maybe they could’ve been, in your mind, but it’s time to look at the reality that the finals will almost definitely be Denver vs Miami and both teams deserve it for how they have played throughout the playoffs. Last thing, if you want to tell someone to “stop trolling on Reddit” make sure you’re doing the same. You can resort to being upset and using profanity to express ur frustration all u want, but at the end of the day the lakers won’t be in the finals and u can’t say Boston vs la *wouldve been* a better finals matchup bc it’s not like them being down 0-3 is some fluke, the series aren’t even close🤷‍♀️ have a nice day\n",
            "And I would also like to add, I understand the point ur trying to get at is Boston vs LA being a better finals matchup on the basis that both of their regular season games went to OT and were exciting to watch, but unfortunately it’s hard to take u seriously in saying this bc a) you’re a lakers fan and b) going to OT during the regular season is not enough to claim that they are the better matchup. This would be a better conversation to have, maybe, if either Boston or LA’s series were close, but to say this when both are down 0-3 is goofy… I’d say performance in the conference finals will be more similar to performance in the finals than regular season games lol. But again, have a nice day 🤦‍♀️\n"
